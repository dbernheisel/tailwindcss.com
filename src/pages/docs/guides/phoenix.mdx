## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Phoenix project if you don't have one set up already.
[Follow the Phoenix installation
guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content) to get your project
setup.

If you're generating a new Phoenix application, the Phoenix generator will
provide a Webpack configuration unless you opt out of it. Below, we will use the
default Webpack configuration.

```shell
mix local.hex
mix archive.install hex phx_new 1.5.7  # Make sure you get the latest version
mix phx.new my_app
# ... Phoenix will list files it creates...
Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn] y
cd my_app
```

Phoenix will prompt you to install dependencies; selecting `y` which will also
fetch node dependencies with `npm`.

The root folder for assets in Phoenix projects is in `./assets`, so to use `npm`
you can either change into the assets directory and use `npm` normally, or use
npm's `--prefix` flag from the project root folder, eg `npm --prefix assets
my-command`.

### Install Tailwind via npm

Install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
npm --prefix assets install -D tailwindcss postcss@^8 autoprefixer@^10 postcss-loader
```

### Add Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin

Add `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` to your PostCSS configuration. Most of the
time this is a `assets/postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project, but
it could also be a `assets/.postcssrc` file, or `postcss` key in your
`assets/package.json` file.

```js
// assets/postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

If you're using any other PostCSS plugins, you should read our documentation on
[using PostCSS as your pre-processor](/docs/using-with-preprocessors) for more
details about the best way to order them with Tailwind.

### Create your configuration file

If you'd like to customize your Tailwind installation, generate a configuration
file for your project using the Tailwind CLI utility included when you install
the `tailwindcss` npm package:

```shell
(cd assets && npx tailwindcss init)
```

This will create a minimal `assets/tailwind.config.js` for your project:

```js
// assets/tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

### Configure Tailwind with Webpack

In `assets/webpack.config.js`, add `postcss-loader` _above_ other pre-processors
such as sass, and below the other loaders. Remember, Webpack runs these
processors from bottom to top, and we want pre-processors to process before
`postcss-loader`.

Learn more about [configuring postcss-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/postcss-loader/).

```diff-js
// assets/webpack.config.js
{
  test: /\.[s]?css$/,
  use: [
    MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
    'css-loader',
+   'postcss-loader',
    'sass-loader',
  ],
}
```

### Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production

In your `assets/tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the
paths to all of your Phoenix templates and JavaScript components so Tailwind can
tree-shake unused styles in production builds:

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: [
+     '../lib/my_app_web/live/**/*.ex',
+     '../lib/my_app_web/live/**/*.leex',
+     '../lib/my_app_web/templates/**/*.eex',
+     '../lib/my_app_web/templates/**/*.leex',
+     '../lib/my_app_web/views/**/*.ex',
+     './js/**/*.js'
+   ],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

You will need to ensure PostCSS is ran with `NODE_ENV=production` when compiling
your assets for production, otherwise purging may not actually run. To ensure
this, edit `assets/package.json` script `deploy`:

```diff-js
- "deploy": "webpack --mode production",
+ "deploy": "NODE_ENV=production webpack --mode production",
```

Read our separate guide on [optimizing for
production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) to learn more about tree-shaking
unused styles for best performance.

### Include Tailwind in your CSS

In `assets/css/app.scss`, remove the placeholder Phoenix CSS, and add the
tailwind directives.

```diff-css
// assets/css/app.scss
- @import "./phoenix.css";
+ @tailwind base;
+ @tailwind components;
+ @tailwind utilities;
```

Phoenix generated with a Webpack configuration that extracts CSS from JavaScript
and outputs compiled CSS into a separate file. This makes Phoenix flexible to
use in conjunction with other front-end frameworks. You'll find the app.scss
imported in `assets/js/app.js`.

```js
// assets/js/app.js
import "../css/app.scss"
```

---

You're finished! Now when you run `mix phx.server`, Phoenix will start Webpack
in watch mode and live-reload CSS changes in your browser. Tailwind CSS is ready
to use in your project.
